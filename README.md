# Gateway
 The Gateway serves as a central entry point for client applications to access various microservices in a secure and manageable manner. Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, is integrated into the Gateway to handle security aspects.

## Features
 ### Microservices Integration:
   The Gateway acts as a reverse proxy, enabling seamless integration with multiple microservices. It provides a unified interface for client applications to interact with the underlying microservices.

 ### Security and Authentication:
  Keycloak, a powerful identity and access management solution, is incorporated into the Gateway. It simplifies the authentication and authorization process, enforcing secure access control for the microservices. Keycloak supports various authentication mechanisms, including username/password, social logins, and single sign-on (SSO).

### Centralized Security Enforcement:
  The Gateway consolidates security enforcement for all microservices. Instead of implementing security features separately in each microservice, the Gateway handles authentication, authorization, and other security-related concerns centrally. This approach ensures consistency and reduces development effort.

### Scalability and Load Balancing:
   The Gateway supports horizontal scalability and load balancing. By deploying multiple instances of the Gateway, it can handle increased traffic and distribute requests efficiently across the microservices.

### Request Routing and Filtering:
  The Gateway enables flexible request routing and filtering capabilities. It can route requests to the appropriate microservice based on predefined rules, perform request filtering, and implement cross-cutting concerns like request logging, rate limiting, and caching.

### API Versioning and Transformation:
  The Gateway facilitates API versioning and transformation. It allows managing different versions of microservices and provides backward compatibility by transforming requests and responses between different API versions.

## Getting Started
To set up the Gateway software locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

- JDK 11 or higher installed.
- Maven build tool installed.
- Keycloak server configured and running.
- Clone the Repository: Clone the Gateway software repository from the provided source code repository URL.

### Configuration:

Open the application.properties file and configure the necessary properties, such as the Keycloak server URL, client credentials, and microservice endpoints.
Customize the routing rules and filters in the configuration file according to your specific requirements.
